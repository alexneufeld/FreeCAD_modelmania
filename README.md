# Model Mania in FreeCAD Link Branch

My attempt to complete all of the 
[SolidWorks Model Mania](https://blogs.solidworks.com/tech/2021/02/22-years-of-model-mania.html)
challenges using Realthunder's [experimental FreeCAD Branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/releases).

Each year in which a challenge was offered has a folder in this repository,
containing the modelled part (or a partially finished attempt).

Notes:
- The challenges usually have a 2 stage format. I've chosen to separate stage 1 
  and 2 into their own files.
- Stage 2 usually has a mechanical simulation component. This part of the challenge
  will be worked on once the modelling parts are as complete as possible.
- All FreeCAD files are saved in Directory format for better 
  behavior under git.
- All files confirmed working with the following FC version:
